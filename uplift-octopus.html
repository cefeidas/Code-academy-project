                    <p>
                        Eclipse Phase information is divided in 14 books. All relevant information about Uplift Octopi can be found in three of them: Eclipse Phase (main book) Transhuman and Panopticon. We encourage you to download those three <a href="https://robboyle.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ps21000_eclipsephase_4thprinting.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://robboyle.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ps21001_eclipsephase_transhuman.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>and <a href="https://robboyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/ps21101_ep_panopticon.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        An uplift Octopus is a fictional sapient creature in the Universe of Eclipse Phase. Uplift is the process of altering an animal species through genetic manipulation and making it sapient and self-aware.

                                Particularly, Uplift Octopi is one of the most bizarre examples of this process, as human species are very far from these molluscs. Its peculiarities are described in more detail in:

                    <p>
                        To help with their socialization, Uplift animals are raised as human children would. However, Original octopus are lonely predators, and this is reflected in their personality despite their early socialization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cautious, reserved, tactical, manipulative... Uplift Octopus spend the majority of their lives in Isolation, and their interactions are usually strictly professional.

                                Their peculiar personality is not the only thing that makes their socialization difficult. Uplift animals are being discriminated or even prosecuted in many places of the Solar system. Some factions defend their rights, and other want them exterminatedâ€¦
