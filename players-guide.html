        <h1>Uplift Octopus: Player's guide</h1>
        <h3>A fanbased addition to the project "Eclipse Phase", from Posthuman Studios.</h3>

                <p class="title">List your traits</p>
                <p>This character is full of nuance. List every trait, characteristic, skill or perk that you want to incorporate to your roleplay. Separate them in categories.</p>
                <p>There will be many!</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <p class="title">"Onion" Strategy</p>
                <p>There are too many traits! Playing an RPG is not like writing a book. Roleplay is all about improvisation. It is not realistic to manage that many traits at the same time.</p>
                <p>Instead, you can group some of these traits into "Aspects". An aspect can be a small phrase  or concept that  gives meaning to a list of your character traits. This will make your character coherent and understandable.   
                    Instead of a big list of traits, we will have a small group of layers, like an onion, each of them coherent and easily understandable.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau</p>    
                
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <p class="title">Learning curve</p>
                <p>The benefit of the "Onion" strategy is that every aspect is enough to play a coherent, plausible and fun character.</p>
                <p>Don't rush. A game campaign can take years. Listen to yourself, and don't try to bite off more than you can chew.</p>
                <p>No matter how experienced you are, this character is very alien. Give yourself time to adapt.</p>
                <p>I would recommend you to try to roleplay no more than one aspect at a time, and add a new layer only when the first one has become your second nature.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau Blaudiblau</p>
